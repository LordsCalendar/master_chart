# Publications

This folder contains LaTeX manuscripts, preprints, technical reports, and supplementary materials related to the **Lord's Lattice** framework (also referred to as the **Unified Field Theory of Time**, UFTT).

- A Logarithmic Fractal Time Lattice from
Ancient Calendrical Integers:
Geological and Mathematical Discoveries

All documents are derived from the core discovery: a single algebraic equation **T(n) = 0** solved for a 3-digit + 15-decimal root **n₀**, generating the master tick **t₁₅ = 0.378432 s** (frequency ≈ 2.642 Hz) from only the mean solar day (86,400 s).

## Key Features of All Manuscripts

- **Parameter-free** — All constants and results derive from fixed inputs: solar day + integer 15 + scriptural ÷1000 scaling.
- **Pre-specified** — Biblical/calendar inputs pre-date modern measurements; no post-hoc fitting.
- **Reproducible** — Most papers include runnable Python/Colab code or SymPy verification snippets.
- **Anomaly strength** — Joint probability of alignments across domains exceeds 10⁻²⁰ (conservative adjusted).
